All of these projects and sample projects are written exclusively by me for the express purpose of demonstrating I know a tiny bit about programming.

My primary goal is to keep learning and pushing myself to gain greater knowledge not just in programming but in every facet of life.

There is no license, but I encourage any one to use, learn from or laugh at anything I have available unless expressly mentioned.
